Welcome to this interactive guide to living
with advanced renal cell carcinoma.

00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:09.840 line:20 position:50% align:center size:65%
Let's start with a few instructions
to this interactive video.

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:14.480 line:20 position:50% align:center size:65%
When a photograph appears,

When you've read enough, click the close tab.

00:00:19.120 --> 00:00:21.800 line:20 position:50% align:center size:65%
If you want to skip forward or go back,

00:00:22.040 --> 00:00:26.840 line:20 position:50% align:center size:65%
use the tabs on the side to navigate around,
take it in at your own pace.

00:00:27.760 --> 00:00:29.200 line:20 position:50% align:center size:65%
And that's it for instructions.

00:00:33.160 --> 00:00:37.520 line:20 position:50% align:center size:65%
I'm Vivian, Viv I was recently diagnosed myself.

00:00:37.720 --> 00:00:41.960 line:20 position:50% align:center size:65%
If this has happened to you or someone
close to you, it's a lot to take in

00:00:43.480 --> 00:00:47.840 line:20 position:50% align:center size:65%
this guide will tell you about the disease
and treatment cut through the jargon.

00:00:49.640 --> 00:00:55.320 line:20 position:50% align:center size:65%
So you've been prescribed Avelumab
and Axitinib by your oncologist.

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:57.160 line:20 position:50% align:center size:65%
This means like me,

00:00:57.160 --> 00:01:00.040 line:20 position:50% align:center size:65%
you have advanced renal cell carcinoma

00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:02.760 line:20 position:50% align:center size:65%
or aRCC for short.

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:09.800 line:20 position:50% align:center size:65%
This video covers different aspects
of life with kidney cancer.

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:14.000 line:20 position:50% align:center size:65%
Remember, you're not alone on this journey,

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:20.600 line:20 position:50% align:center size:65%
your loved ones and your healthcare team are
there to support you through your treatment.

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:23.560 line:20 position:50% align:center size:65%
Let's start with the drugs.

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:27.280 line:20 position:50% align:center size:65%
You have been prescribed two medicines
to treat your kidney cancer,

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:30.160 line:20 position:50% align:center size:65%
Avelumab and Axitinib.

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:33.520 line:20 position:50% align:center size:65%
You need both together as they
work in different ways.

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:40.040 line:20 position:50% align:center size:65%
Avelumab and Axitinib are used together.

00:01:40.480 --> 00:01:44.880 line:20 position:50% align:center size:65%
Clinical trials have proven that there are
advantages to using treatments that

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:49.840 line:20 position:50% align:center size:65%
target the immune system, alongside treatments
that act on tumor blood vessels.

00:01:50.760 --> 00:01:54.720 line:20 position:50% align:center size:65%
It's like dealing with garden pests.
You use one thing to boost the plant,

00:01:54.880 --> 00:01:59.720 line:20 position:50% align:center size:65%
make it stronger another to kill the black fly.

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:04.240 line:20 position:50% align:center size:65%
Avelumab and Axitinib are taken
in different ways.

00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:08.160 line:20 position:50% align:center size:65%
Your healthcare team will tell you exactly
how to take each medicine.

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:15.760 line:20 position:50% align:center size:65%
Most medicines have side effects.

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:20.080 line:20 position:50% align:center size:65%
If you notice any while taking
Avelumab plus Axitinib,

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:23.080 line:20 position:50% align:center size:65%
talk to a member of your
healthcare team immediately

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:25.440 line:20 position:50% align:center size:65%
bearing in mind,

00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:30.720 line:20 position:50% align:center size:65%
side effects can still appear weeks or even
months after your last treatment.

00:02:32.320 --> 00:02:35.960 line:20 position:50% align:center size:65%
If you're struggling with side effects,
tell your healthcare team,

00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:39.960 line:20 position:50% align:center size:65%
they may pause treatment
or change a dose of Axitinib.

00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:45.720 line:20 position:50% align:center size:65%
They might stop treatment with either drug,
don't suffer in silence.

00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:50.280 line:20 position:50% align:center size:65%
Adjusting your dosing helps you
get the best from treatment.

00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:55.160 line:20 position:50% align:center size:65%
You may also be prescribed other medications
to prevent complications

00:02:55.200 --> 00:02:56.760 line:20 position:50% align:center size:65%
or reduce symptoms.

00:02:59.080 --> 00:03:04.280 line:20 position:50% align:center size:65%
You may experience side effects during
or soon after your Avelumab infusion.

00:03:04.760 --> 00:03:08.200 line:20 position:50% align:center size:65%
If you do, tell a member of your
healthcare team immediately,

00:03:08.800 --> 00:03:11.800 line:20 position:50% align:center size:65%
click here to find out about infusion reactions.

00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:21.880 line:20 position:50% align:center size:65%
Receiving a paracetamol and an anti-histamine
before your Avelumab infusion

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:25.200 line:20 position:50% align:center size:65%
could reduce these side effects.

00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:30.200 line:20 position:50% align:center size:65%
If things don't improve your doctor may
recommend a longer infusion time

00:03:32.080 --> 00:03:35.920 line:20 position:50% align:center size:65%
like getting into a pool by the steps
instead of jumping right in

00:03:35.960 --> 00:03:37.800 line:20 position:50% align:center size:65%
less of a shock to the system.

00:03:39.480 --> 00:03:41.640 line:20 position:50% align:center size:65%
So that's the infusion reaction,

00:03:41.920 --> 00:03:47.160 line:20 position:50% align:center size:65%
but you can experience side effects from either
drug at any time during treatment.

00:03:47.200 --> 00:03:49.200 line:20 position:50% align:center size:65%
If any side effects start to develop,

00:03:49.480 --> 00:03:52.120 line:20 position:50% align:center size:65%
tell a member of your healthcare team immediately.

00:03:54.920 --> 00:03:57.680 line:20 position:50% align:center size:65%
There are other common side effects too.

00:03:57.720 --> 00:04:03.440 line:20 position:50% align:center size:65%
If you have concerns, tell your healthcare team
they'll know what to expect, how to help.

00:04:08.960 --> 00:04:12.320 line:20 position:50% align:center size:65%
So how do you live well during treatment?

00:04:13.400 --> 00:04:16.680 line:20 position:50% align:center size:65%
Obviously, good nutrition is important,

00:04:16.720 --> 00:04:21.120 line:20 position:50% align:center size:65%
but you can lose your sense of taste.
Go off things you used to love.

00:04:22.080 --> 00:04:27.080 line:20 position:50% align:center size:65%
Taste is personal, of course, I still
like food with a crunch though,

00:04:27.320 --> 00:04:30.600 line:20 position:50% align:center size:65%
something refreshing, but click here for some ideas.

00:04:35.520 --> 00:04:38.280 line:20 position:50% align:center size:65%
You may find you get tired during treatment.

00:04:39.040 --> 00:04:42.880 line:20 position:50% align:center size:65%
You might not be able to do anything
strenuous that's okay.

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:47.880 line:20 position:50% align:center size:65%
Your body is working hard to
fight this and needs rest,

00:04:47.960 --> 00:04:52.000 line:20 position:50% align:center size:65%
but try to move a little each day.
See a bit of sky.

00:04:54.800 --> 00:04:59.120 line:20 position:50% align:center size:65%
A sore a mouth is a common side effect,
use a soft toothbrush

00:04:59.240 --> 00:05:02.760 line:20 position:50% align:center size:65%
gentle toothpaste and an alcohol
free mouthwash.

00:05:02.800 --> 00:05:09.040 line:20 position:50% align:center size:65%
Avoid alcohol, smoking and spicy food.
Oh, and try drinking through a straw.

00:05:11.720 --> 00:05:15.360 line:20 position:50% align:center size:65%
People can also get a skin rash,
redness and blisters

00:05:17.240 --> 00:05:21.120 line:20 position:50% align:center size:65%
use mild soap and shampoo in
lukewarm water

00:05:21.160 --> 00:05:22.960 line:20 position:50% align:center size:65%
and moisturise dry skin.

00:05:23.080 --> 00:05:27.880 line:20 position:50% align:center size:65%
Baby brands are good un-perfumed and
avoid cleaning products or laundry

00:05:27.880 --> 00:05:29.960 line:20 position:50% align:center size:65%
soaps that could irritate your skin.

00:05:31.640 --> 00:05:36.240 line:20 position:50% align:center size:65%
Occasional diarrhea is a common side effect.
Talk to your healthcare team.

00:05:36.240 --> 00:05:41.040 line:20 position:50% align:center size:65%
If this happens as there's medication
that can help apart from that,

00:05:41.240 --> 00:05:47.200 line:20 position:50% align:center size:65%
treat it like holiday tummy cut down on the
fiber and avoid fatty or spicy foods.

00:05:47.240 --> 00:05:49.800 line:20 position:50% align:center size:65%
Carbohydrates are your friends.

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:55.600 line:20 position:50% align:center size:65%
If you work, you will need to tell the
relevant people about your diagnosis.

00:05:55.920 --> 00:05:59.880 line:20 position:50% align:center size:65%
So you can arrange time off for your
infusions. If you get side effects,

00:06:00.080 --> 00:06:02.320 line:20 position:50% align:center size:65%
you may need to take extra time off.

00:06:02.360 --> 00:06:05.560 line:20 position:50% align:center size:65%
If money is tight, there is support out there.

00:06:09.960 --> 00:06:14.440 line:20 position:50% align:center size:65%
Breaking the news of your diagnosis to
loved ones can be one of the hardest

00:06:14.440 --> 00:06:15.800 line:20 position:50% align:center size:65%
parts of having cancer,

00:06:16.680 --> 00:06:22.120 line:20 position:50% align:center size:65%
but it is important to tell friends and
family so that they can support you

00:06:22.160 --> 00:06:24.120 line:20 position:50% align:center size:65%
practically and emotionally.

00:06:24.960 --> 00:06:28.840 line:20 position:50% align:center size:65%
They may have questions sharing this
guide may help answer them.

00:06:31.840 --> 00:06:35.600 line:20 position:50% align:center size:65%
People will need different amounts
of information at different times,

00:06:36.320 --> 00:06:38.720 line:20 position:50% align:center size:65%
but the internet can be a scary place.

00:06:39.880 --> 00:06:43.360 line:20 position:50% align:center size:65%
The best source of information is
always your healthcare team.

00:06:43.840 --> 00:06:48.640 line:20 position:50% align:center size:65%
They know you and your medical history
and can give advice tailored to you.
