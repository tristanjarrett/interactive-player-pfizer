Lots of patients ask if they can eat and drink normally before and after

00:00:05.240 --> 00:00:09.000 line:13 position:50% align:center size:65%
treatments and you are able to do so. However,

00:00:09.400 --> 00:00:13.480 line:13 position:50% align:center size:65%
we advise that you do not eat grapefruit or 
drink grapefruit juice at any point

00:00:13.480 --> 00:00:17.440 line:13 position:50% align:center size:65%
during your treatment as this may cause 
someone unwanted side effects.
