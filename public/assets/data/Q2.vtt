00:00:00.960 --> 00:00:04.440
The treatment that you have been prescribed
is made up of two medicines that

00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:08.040
work together. They are called Avelumab and Axitinib.

00:00:08.680 --> 00:00:12.320
Avelumab is designed to trigger your body's 
own immune system to help it find

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:13.600
and attack tumors,

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:18.080
whilst the axitinib is aimed at stopping 
the tumors from developing blood

00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:20.280
vessels. So it stops them from growing.
